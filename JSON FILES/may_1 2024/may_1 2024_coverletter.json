During my internship at Resume Page Limited, I developed an AI-powered profile chatbot using Llama and MySQL, improving user engagement by 35%. I also engineered a business card scanner with face recognition, streamlining information exchange by 30%. My prior data analyst internship at IESHER involved analyzing World Bank data to identify policy insights, reinforcing my ability to extract meaningful narratives from complex datasets.\n\nBeyond technical expertise, I am passionate about building impactful solutions. My recent smart fridge platform, developed for a hackathon, integrates inventory tracking with AI-powered recipe recommendations and shopping list generation\u2014demonstrating my ability to merge AI with real-world applications. My leadership experience in tutoring and mentoring has further sharpened my communication and collaboration skills.\n\nI am eager to contribute my analytical skills and AI-driven mindset to ZETA MOTION LIMITED. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with your team\u2019s goals. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your response.\n\nBest regards,\nChristopher Otniel Eleazar"
